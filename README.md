# Forest Trail Scouts site

A single-page, forest-inspired website for Troop 1941. It includes a hero banner, activities overview, photo gallery with modal viewer, embedded Google Calendar, and a contact section.

## Quick start
Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static file server.

### Editing the "What we do" section
Update the JSON inside the `<script type="application/json" id="activities-data">` block in `index.html`. Each object in the `items` array controls a card with `title`, `description`, and `badge` fields.
